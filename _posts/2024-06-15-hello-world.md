# Hello World, Hello Jekyll

This is more a hat tip to Jekyll and the ease to get things set up and auto-deploying to GitHub pages. 
Deploying a site without posts would be bad karma as well. Publishing personal works have been pretty restricted the
past years and now with those restrictions lifted I have a number of projects I plan to start up and keep running posts of.

My wife and I purchased a century home a few years ago. It's what we could afford, where we could afford and with that came a 
queue of maintenance items. Limited funds make for a good research and DIY mode. Fairly significant updates were required that 
would make the house livable. Well, the house is _livable_, but let me say it's a really low low bear minimum bar. The house has 
had bear minimum maintenance in 40 years. Posts to come.

I have my homelab I have been keeping up since 2018 with some significant changes. While I don't have my original powerhouse server,
I'll probably add some nostalgia posts about it and then move on to the low power raspberry pi setup and home assistent.

There's a prethora of other random things that catch my attention and take up a few weekends which sometimes amount to some
junk sitting on a shelf but that's worth while none-the-less.

Jekyll provides a really light weight but powerful engine for all my needs. Usually my flow is to focus on the design and 
layout however, I have found that workflow stalls me and causes me to work on the engine instead of driving the car. So,
the site will be bare bones and slowly get structure as is required as the content prescribes.
